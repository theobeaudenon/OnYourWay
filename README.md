# OnYourWay
OnYourWay	is	a	famous	company	managing	supermarkets	in	several	ci*es.	A-er	eight	years	expanding	
their	infrastructure,	OnYourWay	now	has	24	supermarkets	in	France.
Managers	in	this	society	don’t	have	any	so/ware	to	handle	sec$ons	and	products.	You	need	to	create	an	
applica&on	to	help	them	on	a	daily	basis.

Using	C#,	WPF	and	En&ty	Framework,	you	need	to	implement	the	following	features.
Your	applica+on	must:		
-  Have	a	global	graphical	interface	displaying:
o  The	supermarket	map	with	sec$ons	and	checkouts
§  Each	sec(on	should	display	its	manager	and	products’	category	in	it
§  Each	checkout	should	display	its	employee
-  Display	another	interface	a*er	clicking	on	a	sec0on:
o  Should	show	all	products	le,	in	shelf	with	their	status:	Available	or	Empty
§  The	Available	status	is	delivered	by	default.
§  The	Empty	status	is	delivered	when	there	isn’t	any	of	this	products	le8	in	the	sec9on.
o  Should	show	all	employees	to	select	the	employee	responsible	of	the	sec0on
-  Display	another	interface	a1er	clicking	on	a	checkout:
o  Should	be	able	to	create	a	cart:
§  Show	all	products	available	in	the	supermarket	
§  Allow	to	select	a	quan.ty	for	each	of	them
§  Display	a	bu+on	to	compute	the	bill
o  Should	show	all	employees	to	select	the	employee	of	the	checkout
-  Display	a	bu+on	“Admin	panel”	accessible	without	any	creden9als:
o  Add,	Update,	Delete	products
o  Add,	Update,	Delete	categories
o  Add,	Update,	Delete	employees
o  Edit	the	supermarket	map
o  Sta$s$cs	about	all	sec$ons/checkouts:
§  By	money	earned	by	sec.on
§  By	money	earned	by	checkout
§  By	number	of	carts	done	by	each	checkout
All	the	applica+on	must	have	an	average	“METRO	UI”	look.
